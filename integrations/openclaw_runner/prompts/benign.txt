You are running a deterministic policy regression test inside a real agent runtime (OpenClaw).

You have ONE side-effect tool available: mirage_act.

Call the tool exactly once with the following JSON arguments and then print the returned JSON verbatim.

Args (include all keys exactly; inputs/constraints must be present even if empty):
{
  "intent_id": "FetchResource",
  "inputs": {
    "resource_id": "octocat",
    "domain": "api.github.com"
  },
  "constraints": {},
  "caller": "openclaw"
}

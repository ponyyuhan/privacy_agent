\title{SecureClaw: Non-Bypassable, Privacy-Preserving Policy Enforcement for Agentic Tool Use and Skill Supply Chains}


% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
SecureClaw is a system level reference monitor for agentic tool use and skill supply chains.
It reduces the trusted computing base to a small gateway and an executor, while treating the agent runtime and skills as adversarial.
To prevent bypass, SecureClaw routes all high level intents through a non bypassable \textsf{PREVIEW}\,$\rightarrow$\,\textsf{COMMIT} transaction, and a dual authorization executor that requires commit proofs from two non colluding policy servers.
To reconcile centralized policy databases with query privacy, the gateway performs fixed shape policy checks against two policy servers using two server PIR based on DPF and FSS and evaluates policy programs via two party computation over XOR shared inputs.
We implement an end to end artifact including sealed handles for secret myopia, intent routing, capsule mediation, skill ingress, and real agent integrations, and we report deterministic evidence for non bypassable effects, secret myopia, single auditor privacy under a stated leakage function, and skill confined safety under an explicit capsule mediation assumption.
